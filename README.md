# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-LeNet
One of the first effective CNNs for digit identification was the LeNet architecture, which Yann LeCun unveiled in the late 1980s. LeNet is a perfect fit for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset because, although being somewhat simplistic by today's standards, its architecture is effective and economical for image classification tasks involving tiny, low-dimensional pictures.

The aim of this research is to create a model that can reliably identify and categorize photos of handwritten numbers (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset.
